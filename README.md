## Installation
_**Disclaimer:** this plugin will only work on 64-bit windows machines!_ \
Download the `.dll` file in the `bin/` directory and place it into your DAW's VST folder.
Previous versions of the plugin are also available, in case you need them.

## Compiling The Source Code
_**Note:** you don't need to compile the source code if you just want to use the plugin, just download the `.dll`._ \
Make sure you have Cargo installed on your computer (the Rust compiler). Then in the root of the repository run `cargo build`. Once Cargo is done building, there should be a `HYSTERESIS_v0_3_0.dll` file in the newly created `debug/` directory. Place this file into your DAW's VST folder.
